# Magnetic-Tile-Surface-Defect-Detection-and-Classification
# Abstract
In this project, we have tried to detect surface defects and classify defects in a data set of magnetic tiles containing image defects. We have improved the classification accuracy by parallelizing feature extraction from raw images by CNN and feature extraction based on GT images by semantic segmentation.ã€€In addition, we have confirmed that the use of augmentation improves classification accuracy.
